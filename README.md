# World Generation
A simple project playing around with generating a 2D world(tile grid) using the wave [function collapse algorithm](https://robertheaton.com/2018/12/17/wavefunction-collapse-algorithm/)

## TODO
- Weigh selection of tile variations
- Implement more efficient data structures, such as binary heap for keeping track of tiles with least number of variations
- Read tile variations from a config file to customize world generation
